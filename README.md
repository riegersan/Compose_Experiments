# Compose_Experiments
This is an example App of my own Jetpack Compose Experiments.

The App and the Code you can find here is growing together with 
my Medium articles which you can find [here](https://medium.com/@Rieger_san/)

Feel Free to use snippets for your own projects or contribute if you have ideas for improvements.

The project is not actively maintained. It will grow over time when ever I'm doing something new.
